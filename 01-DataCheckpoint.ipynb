    "What is the significance of the Yen carry trade as it relates to global markets?\n",

    "    - We will use USD/JPY (Dollar/Yen), fluctuations in Japanese Government Bond (JGB) yields, US-Japan base interest rate differentials and volatility in US equity markets via the Chicago Board Options Exchange's (CBOE) Volatility Index as a proxy for the unwinding of Yen carry trade.\n",

    "In 2024 in the first week of August, the global and digital market saw a frantic shift in equities and assets being sold off in response to the unwinding of the Yen carry trade of Japan. The root cause of this being the Bank of Japan as it had increased the interest rate of the Japanese Yen from the range of 0% - 0.1% to 0.25% on July 31 of the same year. This sudden hike in the Japanese Yen’s interest rate in turn strengthened the appreciation of the yen over the US Dollar, which by early August had become a 10% increase in appreciation when previously it had been weakened against the US Dollar by 14% since the end of June 2024. Meanwhile on 2 August  2024, an employment report had shown the expected 179,000 jobs to be created in July was not met and only 114,000 jobs were reported. The combination of events resulted in a mass trade selloff, disrupting the market. As for 2026, by August the interest rate of the Japanese Yen had increased to 0.75%.\n",
    "\n",
    "Some previous work related to Yen carry trade already exist. In 2009 IMF paper by Hattori and Shin tried to figure out if yen carry trades played a role in the 2008 crisis. The authors tracked how much yen foreign banks were moving out of Japan and compared it to the size of U.S. broker-dealer balance sheets over time—basically, when U.S. financial firms were growing their assets, the amount of yen leaving Japan increased proportionally, and when those firms shrank their balance sheets, yen flows reversed. They found a strong negative correlation (slope of -0.89) between changes in yen leaving Japan and domestic Japanese lending, showing that yen was being funneled abroad. Before the crisis, U.S. firms were borrowing cheap yen to invest in higher-yielding assets like mortgage-backed securities, but when the subprime mortgage market collapsed starting in 2007, it triggered a massive deleveraging across global financial markets. As U.S. institutions scrambled to sell assets and pay back their yen loans, this unwinding intensified the crisis.\n",

    "- We believe that a spike in the yields of the 10 and 30 year denominations of Japanese Government Bonds and a narrowing of the US-Japan base interest rate spread indicates that the Yen carry trade is unwinding and that there is a statistically significant correlation between these metrics and volatility in US equities markets.  This is based upon historical evidence from the Yen carry trade unwinding events of 2024 and 2026.  \n",
    "    - On July 31st, 2024 the Bank of Japan (BOJ) increased the base interest rate of the Japanese Yen from a range of 0-0.1% to 0.25% leading to the Yen appreciating by 10% in comparison to the US Dollar.  This resulted in a mass sell off in US equity markets as investors taking part in Yen carry trades were forced to liquidate their positions to avoid any potential losses.  The base US interest rate at this time was set to a target range of 5.25-5.50%, so the increase in the Japanese base interest rate lead to a narrowing of the US-Japan base interest rate spread and resulted in the CBOE VIX Index spiking in the subsequent trading days to the highest levels of 2024.  Showing that a narrowing of the US-Japan base interest rate spread can lead to the Yen carry trade unwinding and that this leads to increased volatility in US equity markets.  \n",
    "    - Earlier this year (2026) between January 19-20th another Yen carry trade unwinding event was observed due to a completely different set of circumstances.  Japan recently elected a new Prime Minister, Sanae Takaichi, and she has called for significant tax cuts and an increase of government spending to combat persistent inflation despite Japan having the highest debt-to-GDP ratio in the world at 236.7 % in 2024.  The Japanese government bond (JGB) market reacted negatively to this plan with a sell-off that pushed all denominations of JGB yields to historic highs.  This created buying pressure on the Yen as Japanese institutions, specifically Japanese life insurers and pension funds, began repatriating capital from foreign markets and Yen carry traders bought up Yen to deleverage their positions.  This led to the Yen appreciating and the ripples of such were felt across global markets with the CBOE VIX Index spiking and broad declines across major US equity indices. Showing that a spike in the yields of the 10 and 30 year denominations of JGBs can lead to the Yen carry trade unwinding with far reaching implications for global financial markets.\n",
    "- Considering that empirical evidence has shown that appreciation of the Yen, fluctuations in JGB yields, a narrowing of the US-Japan base interest rate spread and spikes in the CBOE VIX Index act a proxy for Yen carry trade unwinding events we believe that:\n",
    "    - We can model a correlation between USD/JPY, fluctuations in JGB yields, a narrowing of the US-Japan base interest rate spread and spikes in the CBOE VIX Index.\n",
    "    - We can create a daily composite carry trade stress index whose components consist of the aforementioned Yen carry trade unwind proxy metrics with weighting determined by the loadings of principle component analysis (PCA) to detect the Yen carry trade unwinding events of August 2024 and January 2026.\n",
    "    - The composite carry trade stress index will provide predictive modeling by showing elevated levels of stress (index values above baseline) prior to the Yen carry trade unwinding events of August 2024 and January 2026."

    "- Dataset: Japanese Government Bond (JGB) 10-Year Benchmark Yields (2000–2026)\n",
    "- Dataset Description:\n",
    "    - This dataset focuses on the 10-Year (10Y) Japanese Government Bond yield, measured in annualized percentage (%). During the 2000–2026 period, we see that there is a time of stability for around a decade before Japan goes into a zero and even negative interest rate for a few years. Additionally, we see that there is rapid yield increase between 2024 to 2026, which we are aiming to understand the implications of. One economic position to consider is that Japan's debt to GDP is one of the highest in the world. This could explain why the yield starts off steady and drops down to a negative value by 2016. By having a lower yield, Japan would avoid having to pay back high amounts of interest rates, avoiding default. By similar logic however, we can see that this rapidly increasing yield could definitely be a cause of concern.\n",
    "- Major Concerns and Biases\n",
    "    - A major concern to consider from this is from the idea explained above. If the Japanese government is trying to keep their economy afloat, they may be influencing the bond market in such a way that makes the data more synthetic. What this could mean is that if the economy begins to move out of the government's control, then the predictability for volatility could get difficult. "

    "### A. Data Collection\n",
    " - [X] **A.1 Informed consent**: If there are human subjects, have they given informed consent, where subjects affirmatively opt-in and have a clear understanding of the data uses to which they consent?\n",
    "\n",
    "  Informed consent: Since our research utilizes public, aggregate financial market data—such as Japanese Government Bond yields and the VIX—there are no individual human subjects.\n",
    "\n",
    " - [x] **A.2 Collection bias**: Have we considered sources of bias that could be introduced during data collection and survey design and taken steps to mitigate those?\n",
    "\n",
    "We have considered that financial data from free sources may contain lags or reporting differences compared to professional terminals. To mitigate this, we will use reputable sources like Yahoo Finance, and we will cross-reference dates to ensure accuracy during the volatile periods of 2000 to 2026.\n",
    "\n",
    " - [x] **A.3 Limit PII exposure**: Have we considered ways to minimize exposure of personally identifiable information (PII) for example through anonymization or not collecting information that isn't relevant for analysis?\n",
    "\n",
    "Our dataset is comprised entirely of macroeconomic indicators and market indices. No personally identifiable information (PII) is collected or required for this analysis.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    " - [x] **A.4 Downstream bias mitigation**: Have we considered ways to enable testing downstream results for biased outcomes (e.g., collecting data on protected group status like race or gender)?\n",
    "\n",
    "While our data is primarily numerical market data, we recognize that financial models can reflect broader systemic biases. We will focus our analysis on the mechanical relationship between bond yields and volatility rather than making demographic-based inferences.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### B. Data Storage\n",
    " - [x] **B.1 Data security**: Do we have a plan to protect and secure data (e.g., encryption at rest and in transit, access controls on internal users and third parties, access logs, and up-to-date software)?\n",
    "\n",
    "Our project utilizes a public GitHub repository for storing data and analysis, with write access restricted exclusively to team members and course staff. Given that our dataset is derived entirely from public sources, the information does not contain sensitive or proprietary identifiers requiring advanced encryption. Security is maintained through GitHub’s internal access controls and version history logs.\n",
    "\n",
    " - [x] **B.2 Right to be forgotten**: Do we have a mechanism through which an individual can request their personal information be removed?\n",
    "\n",
    " As our data contains no personal information or individual records, a mechanism for individual data removal is not necessary for this specific project.\n",
    "\n",
    " - [x] **B.3 Data retention plan**: Is there a schedule or plan to delete the data after it is no longer needed?\n",
    "\n",
    " We plan to retain the data only for the duration of the COGS 108 course. Following the final submission and grading period, the repository will be archived or deleted according to course guidelines.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### C. Analysis\n",
    " - [x] **C.1 Missing perspectives**: Have we sought to address blindspots in the analysis through engagement with relevant stakeholders (e.g., checking assumptions and discussing implications with affected communities and subject matter experts)?\n",
    "\n",
    "While our analysis is primarily centered on quantitative market mechanics, we recognize that numerical data alone may not capture the full scope of market behavior. To address potential blindspots, we are incorporating qualitative insights from historical market analyses and expert commentary to identify variables, such as investor psychology, that are not easily quantified. Furthermore, we recognize that geopolitical events often trigger deviations from standard patterns. To mitigate this, we are evaluating high-level policy responses from the Japanese and American governments to better understand the systemic and human factors influencing market volatility.\n",
    "\n",
    " - [x] **C.2 Dataset bias**: Have we examined the data for possible sources of bias and taken steps to mitigate or address these biases (e.g., stereotype perpetuation, confirmation bias, imbalanced classes, or omitted confounding variables)?\n",
    "\n",
    "We have addressed the risk of \"look-ahead bias\" and \"hindsight bias\" by validating our model across distinct market periods. This includes high-stress periods, specifically the volatility spikes of August 2024 and January 2026, as well as periods of relative market stability. To ensure our index is robust and minimizes false positives, we have aggregated historical yield data for 10-year and 30-year bonds dating back to 2000. This longitudinal approach allows us to compare contemporary high-volatility environments against historical baselines, this will ultimately help us mitigate biases within the data.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    " - [x] **C.3 Honest representation**: Are our visualizations, summary statistics, and reports designed to honestly represent the underlying data?\n",
    "\n",
    "To ensure an objective representation of the underlying data, all visualizations will utilize standardized scales and normalization techniques. This is particularly critical when comparing variables with different units, such as JGB yields (percentages) and the VIX (points). We are utilizing the statistical methods provided by the Pandas library, including .describe() and .agg(), to maintain consistency with the analytical standards established throughout the course. \n",
    "\n",
    " - [x] **C.4 Privacy in analysis**: Have we ensured that data with PII are not used or displayed unless necessary for the analysis?\n",
    "\n",
    "Since we do not have data with PII, this will not be necessary.\n",
    "\n",
    " - [x] **C.5 Auditability**: Is the process of generating the analysis well documented and reproducible if we discover issues in the future?\n",
    "\n",
    "Our entire analytical pipeline is hosted on a GitHub repository to ensure full transparency and reproducibility. By utilizing Git version control, we maintain a chronological record of snapshots that allows for the tracing of every code change. Furthermore, we maintain a comprehensive log of model iterations and \"debugging\" notes, documenting specific challenges and the rationale behind architectural changes. This ensures that our methodology is not only auditable but also replicable by third parties or course staff.\n",
    "\n",
    "### D. Modeling\n",
    " - [x] **D.1 Proxy discrimination**: Have we ensured that the model does not rely on variables or proxies for variables that are unfairly discriminatory?\n",
    "\n",
    "Since we are looking at quantatative data (bond yields and interest rate spreads), we do not believe that the variables will be unfairly discriminatory.\n",
    "\n",
    " - [x] **D.2 Fairness across groups**: Have we tested model results for fairness with respect to different affected groups (e.g., tested for disparate error rates)?\n",
    "\n",
    "Our model focuses on macro-level indicators (JGB yields and global volatility); however, \"unwind\" events have disparate impacts on different market participants. High-frequency and institutional traders often have faster access to exit liquidity, while retail investors or smaller funds may bear a disproportionate burden of the subsequent market crash. To address this, we will compare our model's \"stress alerts\" against historical data for both large-cap and smaller-cap indices to evaluate if our index identifies risks equally well for different sectors.\n",
    "\n",
    " - [x] **D.3 Metric selection**: Have we considered the effects of optimizing for our defined metrics and considered additional metrics?\n",
    "\n",
    "While the VIX serves as our primary validation metric for global equity volatility, we recognize that it may not fully capture the nuances of the Yen carry trade. To address this, we have implemented a multi-metric optimization strategy that incorporates the  volatility of Japanese markets. Specifically, we are calculating realized volatility for the USD/JPY exchange rate and yield fluctuations for 10-year and 30-year Japanese Government Bonds (JGBs). By triangulating these mathematical measures, we ensure our stress index accounts for \"funding currency\" liquidity risks and interest rate differentials, rather than acting as a mere proxy for U.S. market sentiment.\n",
    "\n",
    " - [x] **D.4 Explainability**: Can we explain in understandable terms a decision the model made in cases where a justification is needed?\n",
    "\n",
    "Our model utilizes Principal Component Analysis (PCA) to ensure the \"Stress Index\" remains interpretable. By analyzing the factor loadings of each principal component, we can explicitly quantify which financial variables, such as JGB yield shifts or JPY/USD volatility, most heavily influenced the model’s output during a specific period. This provides a transparent rationale for any \"stress\" signals generated. While we acknowledge that financial markets are influenced by various erratic variables, we remove complexity by focusing our explanations on these high-impact macroeconomic drivers, effectively translating high-dimensional data into understandable market narratives.\n",
    "\n",
    " - [x] **D.5 Communicate limitations**: Have we communicated the shortcomings, limitations, and biases of the model to relevant stakeholders in ways that can be generally understood?\n",
    "\n",
    "We will explicitly define our model as a retrospective stress index intended for educational and academic purposes, rather than a framework for active financial trading or professional investment advice. We acknowledge the human tendency for pattern-seeking and the risk of users applying these findings to future market movements. To avoid this, our conclusion will explicity state a disclaimer emphasizing that our analysis provides a high-level, \"macro-scale\" view of the bilateral relationship between Japan and the United States. We will clarify that the model lacks the granularity required for high-frequency or short-term trading and should not be used as a primary decision-making tool in live markets.\n",
    "\n",
    "### E. Deployment\n",
    " - [x] **E.1 Monitoring and evaluation**: Do we have a clear plan to monitor the model and its impacts after it is deployed (e.g., performance monitoring, regular audit of sample predictions, human review of high-stakes decisions, reviewing downstream impacts of errors or low-confidence decisions, testing for concept drift)?\n",
    "\n",
    "Because this project is a retrospective analysis rather than a live production model, continuous real-time monitoring is not required. However, we have established a validation framework to evaluate the model’s enduring relevance. If our \"Stress Index\" shows a strong historical correlation with the VIX, we will perform out-of-sample testing using the most recent 2026 data to check for concept drift, ensuring the mathematical relationships haven't fundamentally shifted. Furthermore, as this is an academic exercise with no high-stakes automated decision-making, we have determined that third-party professional audits are unnecessary; instead, we rely on internal peer review and code reproducibility as our primary quality controls.\n",
    "\n",
    " - [x] **E.2 Redress**: Have we discussed with our organization a plan for response if users are harmed by the results (e.g., how does the data science team evaluate these cases and update analysis and models to prevent future harm)?\n",
    "\n",
    "We have mitigated the potential for harm by strictly defining the project's scope as an academic exercise within the course. Our primary strategy is the inclusion of a clear, non-negotiable financial disclaimer, which explicitly states that the model is for educational purposes and not for live trading. Should an error in our methodology be identified post-deployment, we will address it by updating the public GitHub repository with a \"Correction Log\" to ensure that any downstream users are informed of the revision. By clearly attributing the work to a course-specific context (COGS 108), we distinguish our findings from professional financial ventures.\n",
    "\n",
    " - [x] **E.3 Roll back**: Is there a way to turn off or roll back the model in production if necessary?\n",
    "\n",
    "Our \"roll back\" strategy is centered on Git-based version control. We maintain a detailed commit history that allows us to revert the analytical pipeline to a previous stable state if a specific model configuration is found to be biased or technically flawed. Since the project is a retrospective analysis rather than a live automated system, \"deactivating\" the model involves archiving the repository or adding a prominent notice of deprecation to the documentation. This ensures that any identified errors do not persist in the public-facing version of our research.\n",
    "\n",
    "  - [x] **E.4 Unintended use**: Have we taken steps to identify and prevent unintended uses and abuse of the model and do we have a plan to monitor these once the model is deployed?\n",
    "\n",
    "  As this is a class assignment, the data and result will be restricted to the group and the teaching staff. Although we do not have the ability to control any classmates or viewers actions during the presentation, we will reference back to the disclaimer that we do not release our information for financial use."

    "1. Expectations around communication:\n",
    "    We will meet at least once per week at a time that works for everyone, using Discord or another preferred platform. Most of our meetings will be done through voice calls, since that works best with everyone’s schedules. Team members should also expect a timely response to their messages that is within 24 hours.\n",

    "2. Expectations around tone:\n",
    "    We expect all team members to be respectful and understanding of each other’s situations. If someone feels like we are going in the wrong direction, they should feel comfortable being blunt but polite when speaking up. Clear and respectful communication helps keep everyone on the same page and working toward the same goals.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Expectations around decision making:\n",
    "    We will make decisions collaboratively as a team whenever possible. During our meetings, we will discuss task assignments, responsibilities, and overall priorities. If a decision needs to be made within a short timeframe and some team members are unresponsive, the teammate responsible for that area or task may make the decision to keep progress moving forward.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. Expectations around tasks:\n",
    "    As mentioned previously, we will decide roles and responsibilities together as a team. Tasks will be assigned based on each member’s strengths and what they are best suited for, while still keeping communication open so everyone understands the overall progress of the project.\n",
    "\n",
    "We will have a plan that set certain due dates and scheduled meetings to stay on top of the project. \n",
    "\n",
    "If a team member is struggling to finish something they committed to, they should let the group know as soon as possible so there is enough time to adjust and keep progress moving. We all have moments where things get overwhelming, so no one should feel afraid to ask for help. As a team, we will support each other by redistributing tasks or working together when needed to make sure deadlines are still met. "
