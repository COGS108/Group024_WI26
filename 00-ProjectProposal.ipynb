    "We believe that a spike in Japanese Government Bonds (JGB) yield volatility and a narrowing of US-Japan interest rate spread indicates that the Yen carry trade is unwinding and that there is a statistically significant correlation between these metrics and volatility in US stocks.  More specifically, we believe that a principle component analysis (PCA) based index constructed from normalized JGB market indicators will exhibit statistically significant spikes preceding or concurrent with global volatility surges (VIX) during the August 2024 and January 2026 events.

The ideal dataset for this project would be a multi-source time-series dataset that captures indicators of yen carry trade stress in Japanese markets alongside measures of volatility in US equity markets. Since no single dataset directly measures carry trade activity, we will construct a composite dataset by merging multiple publicly available sources.\n",
    "    1. Key variables: USD/JPY (Dollar/Yen), Japenese Government Bond (JGB) yields and yeild volatility, US-Japan interest rate differentials, global market volatility metrics (VIX index), and date/time index for merging datasets\n",

    "### A. Data Collection\n",
    " - [X] **A.1 Informed consent**: If there are human subjects, have they given informed consent, where subjects affirmatively opt-in and have a clear understanding of the data uses to which they consent?\n",
    "\n",
    "  Informed consent: Since our research utilizes public, aggregate financial market data—such as Japanese Government Bond yields and the VIX—there are no individual human subjects.\n",
    "\n",
    " - [x] **A.2 Collection bias**: Have we considered sources of bias that could be introduced during data collection and survey design and taken steps to mitigate those?\n",
    "We have considered that financial data from free sources may contain lags or reporting differences compared to professional terminals. To mitigate this, we will use reputable sources like Yahoo Finance, and we will cross-reference dates to ensure accuracy during the volatile periods of August 2024 and January 2026.\n",
    "\n",
    " - [x] **A.3 Limit PII exposure**: Have we considered ways to minimize exposure of personally identifiable information (PII) for example through anonymization or not collecting information that isn't relevant for analysis?\n",
    "\n",
    "Our dataset is comprised entirely of macroeconomic indicators and market indices. No personally identifiable information (PII) is collected or required for this analysis.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    " - [x] **A.4 Downstream bias mitigation**: Have we considered ways to enable testing downstream results for biased outcomes (e.g., collecting data on protected group status like race or gender)?\n",
    "\n",
    "While our data is primarily numerical market data, we recognize that financial models can reflect broader systemic biases. We will focus our analysis on the mechanical relationship between bond yields and volatility rather than making demographic-based inferences.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### B. Data Storage\n",
    " - [x] **B.1 Data security**: Do we have a plan to protect and secure data (e.g., encryption at rest and in transit, access controls on internal users and third parties, access logs, and up-to-date software)?\n",
    "\n",
    " All data and analysis will be stored in a private GitHub repository accessible only to team members and course staff. This ensures that our processed data remains secure throughout the project lifecycle.\n",
    "\n",
    " - [x] **B.2 Right to be forgotten**: Do we have a mechanism through which an individual can request their personal information be removed?\n",
    "\n",
    " As our data contains no personal information or individual records, a mechanism for individual data removal is not necessary for this specific project.\n",
    "\n",
    " - [x] **B.3 Data retention plan**: Is there a schedule or plan to delete the data after it is no longer needed?\n",
    "\n",
    " We plan to retain the data only for the duration of the COGS 108 course. Following the final submission and grading period, the repository will be archived or deleted according to course guidelines.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### C. Analysis\n",
    " - [x] **C.1 Missing perspectives**: Have we sought to address blindspots in the analysis through engagement with relevant stakeholders (e.g., checking assumptions and discussing implications with affected communities and subject matter experts)?\n",
    "\n",
    "  Our analysis primarily focuses on quantitative market mechanics. However, we acknowledge that not all market factors are easily identified, so we will consider previous predictions to understand any factors that may not have been considered.\n",
    "\n",
    " - [x] **C.2 Dataset bias**: Have we examined the data for possible sources of bias and taken steps to mitigate or address these biases (e.g., stereotype perpetuation, confirmation bias, imbalanced classes, or omitted confounding variables)?\n",
    "\n",
    " We have examined the risk of \"hindsight bias\". To mitigate this, our model will be tested across both high-stress periods (August 2024, January 2026) and periods of relative stability to ensure the index does not produce frequent false positives.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    " - [x] **C.3 Honest representation**: Are our visualizations, summary statistics, and reports designed to honestly represent the underlying data?\n",
    "\n",
    " Our visualizations will use standardized scales and statistic measurements to ensure that fluctuations in different variables,like JGB yields versus the VIX, are compared fairly and honestly.\n",
    "\n",
    " - [x] **C.4 Privacy in analysis**: Have we ensured that data with PII are not used or displayed unless necessary for the analysis?\n",
    "\n",
    "Since we do not have data with PII, this will not be necessary.\n",
    "\n",
    " - [x] **C.5 Auditability**: Is the process of generating the analysis well documented and reproducible if we discover issues in the future?\n",
    "\n",
    " Our process, from data cleaning to Principal Component Analysis (PCA), will be fully documented in our Jupyter Notebook to ensure reproducibility by other researchers.\n",
    "\n",
    "### D. Modeling\n",
    " - [x] **D.1 Proxy discrimination**: Have we ensured that the model does not rely on variables or proxies for variables that are unfairly discriminatory?\n",
    "\n",
    "Since we are looking at quantatative data (bond yields and interest rate spreads), we do not believe that the variables will be unfairly discriminatory.\n",
    "\n",
    " - [x] **D.2 Fairness across groups**: Have we tested model results for fairness with respect to different affected groups (e.g., tested for disparate error rates)?\n",
    "\n",
    "Our model focuses on macro-level indicators (JGB yields and global volatility); however, \"unwind\" events have disparate impacts on different market participants. High-frequency and institutional traders often have faster access to exit liquidity, while retail investors or smaller funds may bear a disproportionate burden of the subsequent market crash. To address this, we will compare our model's \"stress alerts\" against historical data for both large-cap and smaller-cap indices to evaluate if our index identifies risks equally well for different sectors.\n",
    "\n",
    " - [x] **D.3 Metric selection**: Have we considered the effects of optimizing for our defined metrics and considered additional metrics?\n",
    "\n",
    "We have chosen the VIX as a primary validation metric, but we acknowledge that it primarily measures expected volatility in US equities. To avoid a singular metric, we will also consider the USD/JPY exchange rate velocity and JGB yield spreads as secondary metrics. This multi-metric approach ensures that our stress index isn't just a proxy for US market fear but captures the specific \"funding currency\" stress unique to the Yen carry trade.\n",
    "\n",
    " - [x] **D.4 Explainability**: Can we explain in understandable terms a decision the model made in cases where a justification is needed?\n",
    "\n",
    " By using PCA, we can explain which specific financial features (e.g., JGB yield change) contributed most heavily to the \"stress index\" at any given time, providing a clear rationale for the model's output.\n",
    "\n",
    " - [x] **D.5 Communicate limitations**: Have we communicated the shortcomings, limitations, and biases of the model to relevant stakeholders in ways that can be generally understood?\n",
    "\n",
    " We will clearly state that our model is a retrospective stress index and should be considered to be more of an educational prediction rather than a basis for financial trading or professional investment advice. \n",
    "\n",
    "### E. Deployment\n",
    " - [x] **E.1 Monitoring and evaluation**: Do we have a clear plan to monitor the model and its impacts after it is deployed (e.g., performance monitoring, regular audit of sample predictions, human review of high-stakes decisions, reviewing downstream impacts of errors or low-confidence decisions, testing for concept drift)?\n",
    "\n",
    "Since this is a retroactive view of the past and a prediction based on previous data, we do not have the need to be monitoring performance of the model. Addtionally, as this is not to be taken as professional advice, we do not anticipate a need for another professional's review and decision making ability.\n",
    "\n",
    " - [x] **E.2 Redress**: Have we discussed with our organization a plan for response if users are harmed by the results (e.g., how does the data science team evaluate these cases and update analysis and models to prevent future harm)?\n",
    "\n",
    " As we will explain in our findings that this is not to be taken as professional advice, we will be able to avoid any users that take personal initiative to act on the data and results that we produce in this assignment.\n",
    "\n",
    " - [x] **E.3 Roll back**: Is there a way to turn off or roll back the model in production if necessary?\n",
    "\n",
    " In the context of a Jupyter Notebook submission, \"roll back\" involves version control via Git. We are maintaining a clear history of our model iterations; if a specific analytical approach (like a certain PCA configuration) is found to be misleading or ethically questionable, we can revert to a previous, more stable version of the analysis.\n",
    "\n",
    "  - [x] **E.4 Unintended use**: Have we taken steps to identify and prevent unintended uses and abuse of the model and do we have a plan to monitor these once the model is deployed?\n",
    "\n",
    "  As this is a class assignment, the data and result will be restricted to the group and the teaching staff. Although we do not have the ability to control any classmates or viewers actions during the presentation, we will reference back to the disclaimer that we do not release our information for financial use.\n",
